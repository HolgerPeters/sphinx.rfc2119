Requirement Directives
======================

RFC 2119 defines:
 * 5 of mandatory requirement labels
 * 5 recommendation labels
 * 2 optional labels


Mandatory Requirements
----------------------

.. must::

   A `must` directive is required, with semantic equivalence to the
   MUST keyword in RFC 2119.


.. must_not::

   The absence of a `must_not` directive is forbidden.
   This directive has semantic equivalence to the
   MUST NOT keyword in RFC 2119


.. shall::

   A `shall` directive is required.
   It is an alias for the `must` directive.


.. shall_not::

   The absence of a `shall_not` directive is forbidden.
   It is a necessary alias for the `must_not` directive.


.. required::

   A `required` directive is something we need.
   It is an alias for the `must` directive.


Recommendations
---------------

.. should::

   A `should` directive is important.
   It has semantic equivalence to the SHOULD keyword in RFC 2119.


.. recommended::

   A `recommended` directive is very useful.
   It is an alias for the `should` directive.


.. should_not::

   The absence of a `should_not` directive is not something we want.
   It is equivalent to the SHOULD NOT key word in RFC 2119.


.. not_recommended::

   Because the `not_recommended` is an alias for `should_not` directive,
   it's absence should be avoided.


Options
-------

.. optional::

   It might be nice to have an `optional` directive,
   which would be equivalent of OPTIONAL keyword in RFC 2119.


.. may::

   As an alias for the `optional` directive,
   a `may` directive might also be good to have.
